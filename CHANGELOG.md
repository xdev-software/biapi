## 5.0.3+
Before version 5.0.3, BIAPI was distributed as commercial software. 

To provide this framework as open-source, we split it into two parts: the open-source part you see here and the commercial part, which requires a license. 
If you want to use the commercial BIAPI with third-party dependencies, please contact us at info@xdev-software.de
